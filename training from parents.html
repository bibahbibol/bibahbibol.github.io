                            Before i really go into 'the more detail' topic, let me just ask you all nitizens a 
                            question. How did your parents educate you when you live this long? Well, there are
                            2 choices to this question. Spoiled or mature? For answering this question, you need
                            to look of how your parents treat you, suffer you, how they love you, they say things
                            the body language they to, and how they aslo behave around you. It depends in all of
                            these things. 
                    </p>

                    <p>

                            The meaning of spoiled is a spoiled child or spoiled brat is a derogatory term
                            aimed at children who exhibit behavioral problems from being overindulged by their
                            parents. Children and teens who are perceived as spoiled may be described as 
                            "overindulged", "grandiose", "narcissistic" or "egocentric-regressed". 
                            Characteristic features of children that are treated to be spoiled, 
                            are not wanting to do anything alone (as the child grows older, children will 
                            usually show their ability to share things on their own), often tantrums, do not 
                            respect others, and often ask for more but don't want to share. These characteristics
                            will show by itself. Sometimes kids will not be self-aware of if they're spoiled.
                            They would say that they are mature, but the behavior they do doesn't support on what
                            they say, which sometimes can make people laugh on there own.

                            Now we are moving on to being mature. The definition of mature is a mature person 
                            knows how to prioritize others before themselves. It has been said, “A mature
                            person is one whose agenda revolves around others, not self.” Certainly this can
                            be taken to an extreme, but the ability to get past one's own desires and consider 
                            the needs of others is a powerful mark of maturity. Being someone mature is not as 
                            easy as you probably think. Mature needs a lot of training to do. Mostly, people 
                            can say that they are mature is when they get to the stage of being a teenager or
                            an adult because that is when they get puberty, the stage of getting older, not
                            a child or children anymore. Characteristic features of children that are treated
                            to be mature are:
                            <p>

                                1. Self-awareness
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Maturity grows from a seed of awareness; an awareness of the self and the 
                                actions you take. Being self-aware means you are able to look at yourself
                                through the eyes of an observer. You can take a somewhat neutral stance to 
                                watch your thoughts, actions, and emotions before applying a rational filter 
                                to them.Essentially, self-awareness is about building up an understanding of 
                                your personality; its strengths and weakness, its potential and limitations, 
                                and every little nuance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    2. Self-control
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Once you have established a robust awareness of yourself, you are better 
                                    positioned to exert a degree of self-control.You can identify urges that
                                    build up within your mind and resist the temptation to act on them. 
                                    This might, for example, be the difference between getting angry and 
                                    remaining calm when someone does something you dislike.A mature person
                                    is better placed to show restraint towards things that might be 
                                    detrimental to their short or long term well-being. They can triumph over
                                    some of the more self-destructive behaviors by recognizing them for what
                                    they are.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                   3. Accountability
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you reach a certain level of maturity, you grasp what a great
                                responsibility it is to be human. You accept that we are all accountable 
                                for our own choices and the wider impact they may have on the world.The belief 
                                that things happen to you is eroded and replaced with a proactive mindset that 
                                understands the consequences of your actions. No longer will you live passively 
                                among the world; you take strides to change to your situation where necessary so 
                                that you can live conscientiously.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                   4. Humility
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though you appreciate the importance of each decision you take, you 
                                remain a humble and modest person.You never take yourself to be above others, 
                                regardless of your status, wealth, power, or influence. You know that, when 
                                it comes down to it, we are all born equal and we all die equal. You refrain 
                                from letting any personal success go to your head and you treat people fairly 
                                and respectfully whatever capacity it may be in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    5. Open-mindedness
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Maturity breaks down the mental barriers and unlocks a sense of liberalism 
                                    in an individual. No longer do you see things as black and white or right 
                                    and wrong. Your mind is open to many ideas and opinions and you do not 
                                    judge those who might think differently or choose to live in ways that 
                                    aren’t familiar to you.You also allow your beliefs to soften so as to 
                                    accept the possibility that you may be mistaken at times. You don’t hold 
                                    facts in such high regards, but realize, instead, that there are a great 
                                    number of unknowns in the world.
