                            Before i really go into 'the more detail' topic, let me just ask you all nitizens a 
                            question. How did your parents educate you when you live this long? Well, there are
                            2 choices to this question. Spoiled or mature? For answering this question, you need
                            to look of how your parents treat you, suffer you, how they love you, they say things
                            the body language they to, and how they aslo behave around you. It depends in all of
                            these things. 
                    </p>

                            The meaning of spoiled is a spoiled child or spoiled brat is a derogatory term
                            aimed at children who exhibit behavioral problems from being overindulged by their
                            parents. Children and teens who are perceived as spoiled may be described as 
                            "overindulged", "grandiose", "narcissistic" or "egocentric-regressed". 
                            Characteristic features of children that are treated to be spoiled, 
                            are not wanting to do anything alone (as the child grows older, children will 
                            usually show their ability to share things on their own), often tantrums, do not 
                            respect others, and often ask for more but don't want to share. These characteristics
                            will show by itself. Sometimes kids will not be self-aware of if they're spoiled.
                            They would say that they are mature, but the behavior they do doesn't support on what
                            they say, which sometimes can make people laugh on there own.

                            Now we are moving on to being mature. The definition of mature is a mature person 
                            knows how to prioritize others before themselves. It has been said, “A mature
                            person is one whose agenda revolves around others, not self.” Certainly this can
                            be taken to an extreme, but the ability to get past one's own desires and consider 
                            the needs of others is a powerful mark of maturity. Being someone mature is not as 
                            easy as you probably think. Mature needs a lot of training to do. Mostly, people 
                            can say that they are mature is when they get to the stage of being a teenager or
                            an adult because that is when they get puberty, the stage of getting older, not
                            a child or children anymore. Characteristic features of children that are treated
                            to be mature are:

                                Maturity grows from a seed of awareness; an awareness of the self and the actions you take.
