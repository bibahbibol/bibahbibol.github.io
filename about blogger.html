            <p>
                    I am a 14 year old girl, currently studying in a boarding school in Indonesia. 
                    I was born on the 8th of March in the year of 2005 in Doha, Qatar. It may sound weird to you 
                    of how can i be in another country. 
                    <br>
                    So long story short, my father decided to move to Qatar to find a place to work. He brought 
                    my mother and brother to Qatar at the year around 2003-2004. After that I was born. And now 
                    I am in a family of 5 which consists a father, a mother, a brother, and a little brother.
                    And yes, I am the only daughter.
                    <br>
                    Most of my life, I grew up and spend my time in the city of Dukhan, Qatar. I studied in 
                    an international school named 'Dukhan English School' for about 8 years, continuing the 
                    next step of education in Central Java, Indonesia.
                     
            </p>
               <p>
                    Making and publishing this blog was a unbelievable thing because there wasn't a initiative 
                    to create one. It started off by sitting in class, talking with the girls until one of my 
                    friend said that I was called to go to the computer lab. Well, I thought that was something 
                    fun. I didn't have expect to join a website training guidance from an organizition called 
                    'BE KRAF'. This is an organization where they teach mostly about technology and computer.
                    Their destination to be here is to teach is how to make a website or you can aslo call it 
                    a 'blog'. And guess what? This is my creation.
                    <br>
                    My hope after this is that I want to continue my career in doing this blog. Also there 
                    is something new I wanted to try on since ages ago, which is being a Youtuber. Hopefully 
                    this can aslo make my blog to be success.
               </p>
              <p>
                    My last word I just want to say thank you for clicking my blog and reading through it 
                    thoroughly. I am sorry if there are many mistakes in this blog because I am not a 'pro' and 
                    I am still learning step by step carefully. Thank you very much! 
                  </p>
