            About the Blogger
        </h1>
         A baby girl was born on a Tuesday midnight on the 8th day of the 3rd month on the
         year of 2005. Who was it? It was me.
         <br>
         Well, my name is Ummi Habibah, but I am more known as Habibah Mazatra. Friends and family usually call
         me different things so for you all, you can call me 'Bibah'. Let me tell you a short story about my 
         past life or you can even call it childhood life.
         I was born with a mother and a father in the city of Doha located in Qatar. My parents nationality is
         actually Indonesian so lots of you are wondering how could I stray to Qatar? Well, the reason was that
         my father decided to work in anothr country which is Qatar and he had that decision when I wasn't born
         yet.
