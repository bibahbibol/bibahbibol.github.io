                            Every people in this world have their own different personality. Getting them to
                            behave well or be a good person is quiet difficult. This is all because that not 
                            all people will want and not all ways work. 'Different person, different problems,
                            and different method'. 
                    </p>
                         <p>
                            Good behavior means orderly and lawful action; conduct that is deemed proper for a 
                            peaceful and law-abiding individual. The Constitution of the United States 
                            provides that federal judges shall hold their offices during good behavior, 
                            which means that they cannot be discharged but can be impeached for misconduct.
                            Behave yourself means to tell someone to stay out of trouble. 
                            Normally this is used to tell children to behave appropriately. However, friends use 
                            it with one another like they use "stay out of trouble."  Drive and determination 
                            will help you keep going no matter what. Compassion and understanding mean you 
                            relate well to others. Patience is a virtue and also a good personality trait. 
                            Courage will help you do what's right in tough situations. Loyalty is a good 
                            quality to possess, making others trust you.
