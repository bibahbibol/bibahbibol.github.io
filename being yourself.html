                                Being yourself means you like who you are. Being yourself means
                                living life how you want to live it, regardless of other people's
                                opinions. And it means you respect yourself. Don't worry about what 
                                others think. You can't control them or their thoughts.

                                In general, "be yourself" means be true to your core identity rather
                                than faking a different one because you think it will be attractive to 
                                others. But we can take it one step further and say that you should
                                also try to the best "you" that you can be, being the ideal "yourself."
