                                Being yourself means you like who you are. Being yourself means
                                living life how you want to live it, regardless of other people's
                                opinions. And it means you respect yourself. Don't worry about what 
                                others think. You can't control them or their thoughts.

                                In general, "be yourself" means be true to your core identity rather
                                than faking a different one because you think it will be attractive to 
                                others. But we can take it one step further and say that you should
                                also try to the best "you" that you can be, being the ideal "yourself."

                                People are sometimes struggling on being who they are. They maybe sometimes 
                                are not thankfull of what God give to them. Well, God has given all humans 
                                nearly everything same which are 2 eyes, 2 hand, a body, 2 legs, and many
                                more. Like what is not enough, right? Maybe is not easy for people to 
                                thank because not all mankind are born with all of these things, but at 
                                least that God has brought us to life and gave us souls so that we can live.
