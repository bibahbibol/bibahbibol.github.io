                                Being yourself means you like who you are. Being yourself means
                                living life how you want to live it, regardless of other people's
                                opinions. And it means you respect yourself. Don't worry about what 
                                others think. You can't control them or their thoughts. 
                                
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                In general, "be yourself" means be true to your core identity rather
                                than faking a different one because you think it will be attractive to 
                                others. But we can take it one step further and say that you should
                                also try to the best "you" that you can be, being the ideal "yourself."

                                People are sometimes struggling on being who they are. They maybe sometimes 
                                are not thankfull of what God give to them. Well, God has given nearly all humans 
                                everything the same which are 2 eyes, 2 hands, a body, 2 legs, and many
                                more. Like what is not enough, right? Well, not all mankind has all of it perfect,
                                people that lost one of their body parts is given a lesson by God of how to be a 
                                strong person and not always complaining on what they have. Also it teaches them 
                                how to always be thankful of what they have and what has God given to them.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                                Maybe is not easy for people to 
                                thank because not all mankind are born with all of these things, but at 
                                least that God has brought us to life and gave us souls so that we can live.
                                But you know what, we all can be thankfull of everything we have by just getting used to it and always 
                                be proud of yourself at any time. Below, here are some tips that you should do to be yourself:

                                <h4>
                                    1. Don’t Worry About How Others View You
                                </h4>

                                Occasionally thinking about how others view you may make you change for the good, but you should not 
                                be constantly wondering about what others are thinking. You should change if you want to, and change 
                                into what or who you want to change into. If people are criticizing you and you think that personality 
                                that they are judging you is something that you have to change, change so that you can make other people 
                                happy.

                                <h4>
                                    2. Don’t Aim to Please Others
                                </h4>

                                There is a problem if you are never doing what you want to do, yet always doing what everyone else 
                                wants to do. Pleasing others can be a nice thing to do, but know where your boundaries are. Instead 
                                of always aiming to please others, you should do things for yourself as well every now and then.

                                <h4>
                                        3. Appreciate Who You Are
                                </h4>

                                No matter how weird you are, appreciate yourself! Each person is unique, and everyone has at least 
                                a little weirdness in themselves. Appreciate your weirdness and let it out. I know maybe it's a struggle 
                                to always appreciate and be proud but this is one of the best way to do that people could also actually 
                                appreciate of who you are.  Instead of doubting yourself all the time, you should be confident with 
                                yourself and who you are. Showing confidence in yourself and your decisions will also show to others 
                                that you know what you are doing.

                                <h4>
                                        4. Forgive Yourself
                                </h4>

                                Forgive yourself for thinking negatively. Forgive yourself for talking, without thinking twice. 
                                Forgive yourself for being rude to your superiors, your friends, your parents, or your siblings. 
                                Don’t think negative thoughts about yourself for taking wrong steps or making wrong decisions. 
                                This kind of thinking puts your focus on the problem and not the solution. It’s better to say good 
                                things about yourself than to say negative things. Always saying positive things about yourself is a 
                                sign that you have forgiven yourself. Do you look at everything as a glass half full or a glass half empty? 
                                It can be easy to be negative about yourself. When it comes to being happy, it is vital that you learn how 
                                to be yourself and to be more positive.

                                <h4>
                                        5. Strive for What You Want to Accomplish
                                </h4>

                                Being yourself does not have to mean that you have to be stuck in status quote, like not finding and having 
                                your own inspirations. Aim for what you want to achieve and strive for that accomplishment. 
                                You can improve yourself while still remaining true to yourself.
