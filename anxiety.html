                        The American Psychological Association (APA) defines anxiety as "an emotion 
                        characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like 
                        increased blood pressure."Knowing the difference between normal feelings of anxiety
                        and an anxiety disorder requiring medical attention can help a person identify and 
                        treat the condition. In this article, we look at the differences between anxiety and
                        anxiety disorder, the different types of anxiety, and the available treatment options.

                            What is social anxiety disorder or social phobia?
                      </h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Many people get nervous or self-conscious on occasion, like when giving a speech or 
                            interviewing for a new job. But social anxiety disorder, or social phobia, is more 
                            than just shyness or occasional nerves. Social anxiety disorder involves intense 
                            fear of certain social situations—especially situations that are unfamiliar or in 
                            which you feel you’ll be watched or evaluated by others. These situations may be so 
                            frightening that you get anxious just thinking about them or go to great lengths to 
                            avoid them, disrupting your life in the process. Underlying social anxiety disorder 
                            is the fear of being scrutinized, judged, or embarrassed in public. You may be afraid 
                            that people will think badly of you or that you won’t measure up in comparison to 
                            others. And even though you probably realize that your fears of being judged are at 
                            least somewhat irrational and overblown, you still can’t help feeling anxious. But no 
                            matter how painfully shy you may be and no matter how bad the butterflies, you can 
                            learn to be comfortable in social situations and reclaim your life.

                            Although it may feel like you’re the only one with this problem, social anxiety is 
                            actually quite common. Many people struggle with these fears. But the situations 
                            that trigger the symptoms of social anxiety disorder can be different.Some people 
                            experience anxiety in most social situations. For others, anxiety is connected to 
                            specific social situations, such as speaking to strangers, mingling at parties, 
                            or performing in front of an audience. Common social anxiety triggers include 
                            meeting new people, making small talk, public speaking, performing on stage,
                            being the center of attention, being watched while doing something, being teased or 
                            criticized, talking with “important” people or authority figures, being called on 
                            in class, going on a date, speaking up in a meeting, using public restrooms, taking
                            exams, eating or drinking in public, making phone calls, and attending parties or 
                            other social gatherings.

                            When an individual faces potentially harmful or worrying triggers, feelings of 
                            anxiety are not only normal but necessary for survival.Since the earliest days of 
                            humanity, the approach of predators and incoming danger sets off alarms in the 
                            body and allows evasive action. These alarms become noticeable in the form of 
                            a raised heartbeat, sweating, and increased sensitivity to surroundings.
                            The danger causes a rush of adrenalin, a hormone and chemical messenger in the 
                            brain, which in turn triggers these anxious reactions in a process called the 
                            "fight-or-flight' response. This prepares humans to physically confront or flee 
                            any potential threats to safety.
                            For many people, running from larger animals and imminent danger is a less 
                            pressing concern than it would have been for early humans. Anxieties now revolve 
                            around work, money, family life, health, and other crucial issues that demand a 
                            person's attention without necessarily requiring the 'fight-or-flight' reaction.
                            The nervous feeling before an important life event or during a difficult 
                            situation is a natural echo of the original 'fight-or-flight' reaction. 
                            It can still be essential to survival – anxiety about being hit by a car 
                            when crossing the street, for example, means that a person will instinctively 
                            look both ways to avoid danger.

                            The duration or severity of an anxious feeling can sometimes be out of proportion 
                            to the original trigger, or stressor. Physical symptoms, such as increased blood 
                            pressure and nausea, may also develop. These responses move beyond anxiety into 
                            an anxiety disorder.
                            The APA describes a person with anxiety disorder as "having recurring intrusive 
                            thoughts or concerns." Once anxiety reaches the stage of a disorder, it can 
                            interfere with daily function.

                            Just because you occasionally get nervous in social situations doesn’t mean you 
                            have social anxiety disorder or social phobia. Many people feel shy or 
                            self-conscious on occasion, yet it doesn’t get in the way of their everyday 
                            functioning. Social anxiety disorder, on the other hand, does interfere with 
                            your normal routine and causes tremendous distress.
                            For example, it’s perfectly normal to get the jitters before giving a speech. 
                            But if you have social anxiety, you might worry for weeks ahead of time, call 
                            in sick to get out of it, or start shaking so bad during the speech that you 
                            can hardly speak.

                            Treatment
                      </h3>

                        In some cases, a person can treat an anxiety disorder at home without clinical 
                        supervision. However, this may not be effective for severe or long-term anxiety 
                        disorders.
                        <br>
                        There are several exercises and actions to help a person cope with milder, 
                        more focused, or shorter-term anxiety disorders, including:
                        <p>
                              1. Stress management: Learning to manage stress can help limit potential triggers. Organize any upcoming pressures and deadlines, compile lists to make daunting tasks more manageable, and commit to taking time off from study or work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              2. Relaxation techniques: Simple activities can help soothe the mental and physical signs of anxiety. These techniques include meditation, deep breathing exercises, long baths, resting in the dark, and yoga.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              3. Exercises to replace negative thoughts with positive ones: Make a list of the negative thoughts that might be cycling as a result of anxiety, and write down another list next to it containing positive, believable thoughts to replace them. Creating a mental image of successfully facing and conquering a specific fear can also provide benefits if anxiety symptoms relate to a specific cause, such as in a phobia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              4. Support network: Talk with familiar people who are supportive, such as a family member or friend. Support group services may also be available in the local area and online.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              5. Exercise: Physical exertion can improve self-image and release chemicals in the brain that trigger positive feelings.
                        </p>
