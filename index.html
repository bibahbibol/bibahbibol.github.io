                        There are a some definitions of 'inspire' that i found on the
                        internet. But on this blog, the word 'inspire' means to excite,
                        encourage, or breathe life into. Inspire comes from the 
                        Latin word that means to inflame or to blow in to. 
                        When you inspire something, it is as if you are blowing 
                        air over a low flame to make it grow. A film can be inspired
                        by a true story.

                        The word 'finish' means to bring (a task or activity) to an end;
                        complete. The word 'method' means a particular form of procedure
                        for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a
                        systematic or established one. In a short way, finishing method 
                        means a process of completing a task or activity. Of course 
                        every situation or problems has a way to get out.
