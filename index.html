                        There are a some definitions of 'inspire' that i found on the
                        internet. But on this blog, the word 'inspire' means to excite,
                        encourage, or breathe life into. Inspire comes from the 
                        Latin word that means to inflame or to blow in to. 
                        When you inspire something, it is as if you are blowing 
                        air over a low flame to make it grow. A film can be inspired
                        by a true story.

                    <p>
                        Problem means a matter or situation regarded as unwelcome or 
                        harmful and needing to be dealt with and overcome. Everyone must have a problem,
                        whether it's with a friend, family, or strangers. Having a problem doesn't means the method of finishing it is 
                        avoiding or running away. People usually call it 'lame' which means that they cannot finish their problem by their own.

                        The word 'finish' means to bring (a task or activity) to an end;
                        complete. The word 'method' means a particular form of procedure
                        for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a
                        systematic or established one. In a short way, finishing method 
                        means a process of completing a task or activity. Of course 
                        every situation or problems has a way to get out.
